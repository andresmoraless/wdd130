        <h2>Client Report</h2>
        <p>As a client, I decided to use very simple and minimalistic pictures for my website, since I wanted the design to look very clean and modern. AI was a great tool to get those pictures the way that I wanted them, and to suggest how some elements could look more visually appealing. I communicated with my developer mostly in person, but I sent my wireframe and gave specific instructions via email. I don't feel like there were any issues, since I tried to make it as effective as
        possible and my developer was very receptive and open. My developer met most of my expectations, the site looks clean but it lacks simple interactive elements such as hover effects. Also (at the time of writing this), the other pages aren't done at all, which means that there wasn't much communication between the lead and junior developers. Next time I hire a team to do a project for me, I'd touch base with them more frequently and be very clear about my design from the beginning. 
        </p>

        <h2>Lead Developer Report</h2>
        <p>I managed my development team through constant communication, or at least the attempt of such. I asked my client to be as specific as possible for what he wanted so I could set a clear goal of what to achieve. I communicated with my junior developers through email and sent them the wireframe as soon as I got it. It was difficult with one of my junior devs because he had been gone for a couple weeks, but when he came back I put him up to speed and gave him the tools he needed. Communicating with my client was mostly done in person, the only challenge was that he was MIA most weeks and didn't give much detail as to what he wanted, but we got the work done. Publishing my client's site was quite simple, and I just sent him the url via email so he could check the progress whenever he wanted. Managing my site with GitHub was tricky at first, but then I got the hang of how things worked and it was smooth sailing from there.</p>

        <h2>Junior Developer Report</h2>
        <p>As a junior developer, one of my team leads communicated with me through Teams and the other one mostly in person or email. The communication was pretty clear and straightforward for one of the sites, but for the other one I hadn't heard anything from my lead developer for a couple weeks. I tried emailing him to get instructions but didn't get a response until the last week. Therefore, for one of the sites I knew pretty clearly what was expected of me, but for the other one I had no idea what I had to do or what the site was even about up until the last minute. However, I was still able to contribute for both sites and get my part done. GitHub worked great throughout the process and I had no issues when making changes.</p>

        <h2>General Reflection</h2>
        <p>The most challenging part of this project was definitely communicating with different groups of people to get the job done. The reason for this is because a lot of them were not usually in class or didn't respond to emails. However, I was able to get a hold of everyone I needed to communicate with and I sought to do it as efficiently as possible, which helped getting things moving. I enjoyed the challenge of creating something that I didn't design; getting to understand the vision of the client and bringing that to life was fun. If I could do the project again, I'd communicate more with my developer as a client, to provide more feedback and be clearer in what I want. Other than that, I wouldn't do anything else differently. This helped me feel more confident in working in real-world projects, since I held myself up pretty great and was able to deliver the product that my client and developers wanted. Even with challenges I was able to find a way around and do my best to get things done.</p>
